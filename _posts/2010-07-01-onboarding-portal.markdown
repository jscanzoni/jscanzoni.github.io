description: The Employee Onboarding Portal was an system which automatically created new user accounts and email addresses for new employees and allowed them to change their own passwords--all without having to contact the IT help desk. The project resulted in an immediate 10-percent reduction in help desk tickets by eliminating account maintenance requests. The portal also provided new employees a quick corporate systems training to allow them to hit the ground running immediately.
